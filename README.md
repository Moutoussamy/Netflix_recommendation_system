# Netflix  Content-Based Recommendation System (CB-RS)
 
Based of the data avalaible on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows) I made a CB-RS.

The dataset contains 12 descriptors (columns):
- Show_id (int): unique ID
- type (str): TV show or movie
- director (str); movie director
- cast (str): cast of the movie
- country (str): contry of origin
- date_added (str): date 
- release_year (int):release year of the movie
- rating (str): Age limit
- duration (str): duration of the movie
- listed_in (str): type of movie (adventure, action, ...)
- description (str): description of the movie

Here are the steps that I followed:

    Step 1: Data collection - Read the data
    Step 2: Let's visualize and clean the data for CB-RS
    Step 3: Recommendation System - Content based
    Step 4: Test
